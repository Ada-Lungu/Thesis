\section{Company Description}

This is a project done in collaboratino with \sfun. 
\sfun is a small company, a start up that outset its activity in 2016. The company's vision is to 
come up with a friendly and holistic environment for children where they practice STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) using interactive and playful methods. \\

They create an learning environment by providing workshops, where kids are involved in hands-on projects in coding and electronics. Children experiment with building robots, motors, using sensors and coding these devices. They learn a lot empirically by trial and error.  \\

Part of solution they envision in creating a holistic learning experience is an online platform that will incorporate the knowledge transfer and learning materials of the actual workshops. We have already started to do that migration of information towards the platform. At the moment we are using the beta version of the platform as a helping material in our workshops, until step by step it will replace the need of tutors and running the workshops in a traditional way. \\

Workshops constitute the perfect testing environment for our application, as we receive constant feedback by observing kids interaction with it. Using them as a testing grounf for the platform assured the selection and prioritising of the developed features based of the users reactions.
